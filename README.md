# Con De Nast

A repo for Con de Nast interview

This is the backend repository for the news APP 


# Points to be noted before starting app

* Please install all dependencies once the repository is cloned. It is expected to run this backend app before running front end application

* The package.json is saved with all the dependencies required. so "npm install" on root directory of this app will help you to get all dependencies installed

* once the dependencies are installed, please make sure the REDIS is installed in your machine, If not installed, please install redis with the help of below links
https://redis.io/topics/quickstart

Note : Though using redis is optional, i personally recommend to use as it would minimize frequent usage of third party API
if you still dont want to use redis, Please set "false" in config againt key "use_redis"

* Usage of logger is also optional, please configure the key "use_logger" from config.json as per your wish
